Hop-E-DON - React E-Commerce Platform
Welcome to Hop-E-DON, your ultimate shopping destination! This project is built with React and Vite to provide a fast and dynamic user experience. It includes modern features like dark mode/light mode toggle, responsive layout, and a fully functional accordion section for easy navigation.

Why "Hop-E-DON"?
The name Hop-E-DON is derived from the reverse of "NODE", symbolizing a fresh perspective and a unique approach to modern web development. The name reflects our philosophy of innovating and "hopping" beyond conventional boundaries, just as the platform aims to provide a dynamic and enjoyable e-commerce experience.


Features Implemented

React & Vite Setup:
This project is set up using React for building the user interface and Vite as the build tool for faster development with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

Dark Mode & Light Mode:
A toggle functionality that allows users to switch between dark and light themes for a personalized browsing experience.
The dark mode includes a dark blue background (#1e3a5a) with white text, and the light mode features a light blue background (#87d3ec) with black text.

E-Commerce Home Page:
The landing page is designed with a modern e-commerce theme, welcoming users to explore the latest trends in fashion, tech gadgets, and home decor.
The page content dynamically adapts to dark and light modes, ensuring optimal readability and design.

Accordion Component:
Integrated a custom accordion section to provide detailed information about products, shipping, and customer support.
The accordion uses Bootstrap's accordion-flush design for a clean, collapsible UI component.

Styled Components:
Used inline styles for key components to ensure smooth transitions between themes and a polished look.
The content areas feature box shadows and smooth transitions, making the UI look elegant and responsive.
